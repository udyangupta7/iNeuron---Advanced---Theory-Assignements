    "#### Q1: What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Main Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Class - A class is a collection of objects. A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created. It is a logical entity that contains some attributes and methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Objects - The object is an entity that has a state and behavior associated with it. It may be any real-world object like a mouse, keyboard, chair, table, pen, etc. Integers, strings, floating-point numbers, even arrays, and dictionaries, are all objects. More specifically, any single integer or any single string is an object. The number 12 is an object, the string “Hello, world” is an object, a list is an object that can hold other objects, and so on. You’ve been using objects all along and may not even realize it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism - Polymorphism simply means having many forms. For example, we need to determine if the given species of birds fly or not, using polymorphism we can do this using a single function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Encapsulation - Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. Those types of variables are known as private variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Inheritance - Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. The class that derives properties is called the derived class or base class and the class from which the properties are being derived is called the base class or parent class. The benefits of inheritance are:\n",
    "\n",
    "        i. It represents real-world relationships well.\n",
    "\n",
    "        ii. It provides the reusability of a code. We don’t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.\n",
    "\n",
    "        iii. It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q2: Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A2: \n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q3: How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A3: \n",
    "\n",
    "A class describes a data type. An instance of a class is an object of the data type that exists in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q4: What makes the first argument in a class’s method function special?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A4: \n",
    "\n",
    "The first argument of every class method, including init, is always a reference to the current instance of the class. By convention, this argument is always named self. In the init method, self refers to the newly created object; in other class methods, it refers to the instance whose method was called.27-Jan-2014\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q5:  What is the purpose of the __init__ method?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A5: \n",
    "\n",
    "The __init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java. Constructors are used to initialize the object’s state. The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of class is created. Like methods, a constructor also contains collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at time of Object creation. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q6: What is the process for creating a class instance?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A6: \n",
    "\n",
    "When you create an object, you are creating an instance of a class, therefore \"instantiating\" a class. The new operator requires a single, postfix argument: a call to a constructor. The name of the constructor provides the name of the class to instantiate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q7: What is the process for creating a class?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A7:\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is created from a class using the new keyword. There are three steps when creating an object from a class:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Declaration − A variable declaration with a variable name with an object type.\n",
    "2. Instantiation − The 'new' keyword is used to create the object.\n",
    "3. Initialization − The 'new' keyword is followed by a call to a constructor. This call initializes the new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q8: How would you define the superclasses of a class?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A8: \n",
    "\n",
    "The class from which a class inherits is called the parent or superclass. A class which inherits from a superclass is called a subclass, also called heir class or child class. Superclasses are sometimes called ancestors as well"
