    "\n",
    "When using modules, we import (call) a module and then we use it. We can import only certain parts(exports) of a module, we can import the default export, if the module has one, but nothing more then that.\n",
    "\n",
    "And when we are writing a module, we export things out of it. We can even make one of the things (things here can be anything - a string, a number, a null, a function, class, object, etc.), we exported the default export, but not necessarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in practice, in some environments, our modules will typically have only one export, and that export will be a class. So in such cases, there’s almost a one-to-one relation with modules and classes, but I don’t think it ever IS fully one-to-one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, a class is simply a special way (to some more clear, to some more confusing) of writing a object constructors. Basically it’s a function, just written in a certain way. So when exporting a “class”, we’re exporting a function.\n",
