    "#### Question 1: Which two operator overloading methods can you use in your classes to support iteration?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Answer 1: \n",
    "\n",
    "Operator overloading is the process of using an operator in different ways depending on the operands. You can change the way an operator in Python works on different data-types.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very popular and convenient example is the Addition (+) operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just think how the ‘+’ operator operates on two numbers and the same operator operates on two strings. It performs “Addition” on numbers whereas it performs “Concatenation” on strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __ iter __ method returns the iterator object and is implicitly called at the start of loops. \n",
    "\n",
    "The __ next __ method returns the next value and is implicitly called at each loop increment. This method raises a StopIteration exception when there are no more value to return, which is implicitly captured by looping constructs to stop iterating.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex:"

    "#### Question 2: In what contexts do the two operator overloading methods manage printing?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Answer 2: \n",
    "\n",
    "The __ str __ & __ repr __ are two operator overloading methods that manage printing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Short, the difference between both these operators is the goal of __ repr __ is to be unambiguous and __ str __ is to be readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we are printing any object reference internally __ str __ method will be called by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of __ str __ is for readability. it prints the informal string representation of an object, one that is useful for printing the object. it may not be possible to convert result string to original object.\n",

    "__ repr __ is used to print official string representation of an object, so it includes all information and development.\n",
