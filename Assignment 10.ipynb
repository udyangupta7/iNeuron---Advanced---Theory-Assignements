    "#### Question 1: What is the difference between __ getattr __ and __ getattribute __ ?\n",
    "#### Answer 1: \n",
    "__ getattribute __ is used to find an attribute of a class. It raises an AttributeError of it fails to find an attribute of a class. __ getattr __ is implemented latter if AttributeError is generated by __ getattribute __ , but for this __ getattribute __ and __ getattr __ both has to be defined in same class. If no attribute is found, __ getattr __ returns a default value. So key difference is that __ getattr __ is called for attributes that don't actually exist on a class.\n",

    "#### Question 2: What is the difference between properties and descriptors?\n",
    "#### Answer 2:\n",
    "The differences between Properties and Descriptors is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties: With Properties we can bind getter, setter and delete functions together with an attribute name, using the built-in property function or @property decorator. When we do this, each reference to an attribute looks like simple, direct access, but involes the appropriate function of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptor: With Descriptor we can bind getter, setter and delete functions into a seperate class. we then assign an object of this class to the attribute name in our main class. When we do this, each reference to an attribute looks like simple, direct access but invokes an appropriate function of descriptor object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 3: What are the key differences in functionality between getattr and getattribute, as well as properties and descriptors?\n",
    "#### Answer 3:\n",
    "The Key Differences between __ getattr __ , __ getattribute __ , Properties and Descriptors are:\n",
    "\n",
    "__ getattr __ : Python will call this method whenever you request an attribute that hasn't already been defined\n",
    "\n",
    "__ getattribute __ : This method will invoked before looking at the actual attributes on the object. Means,if we have __ getattribute __ method in our class, python invokes this method for every attribute regardless whether it exists or not.\n",
